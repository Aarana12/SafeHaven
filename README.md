# Final Project Starter

This will be the starter code for your final project! But first, we're going to spend a day making improvements to it. We'll use pull requests to manage this, and for that you'll need to be on your own branch. You can work in pairs or on your own.

## 1. Create your branch

After cloning this repo to your computer, **make a new branch** with your name! All of your changes need to be on this branch.

## 2. Add firebase config and Explore!

Get the code running! You'll need to add a `firebase.js` file. You should be able to use the exact some one you used in your snapchatbots project.

## 3. Improve the starter code

Pick something you want to fix/add about the starter code, put it in the Slack and work on it! Use slack to make sure we don't have too much overlap, but you can always collaborate with others if you both want to work on the same thing!

## 4. Create your pull request

More instructions to come.
